<h1>For Client Code: </h1>
npm init -y </br>
npm install </br>
npm init and npm install is just to make sure all the dependencies and start up codes are installed </br>
<h2>To run the actual code: </h2>
> node index.js or nodemon
For Server code: same steps as client but npm install in warbler-server directory and then start by either typing nodemon or node index.js
